Color Blocks
===

In this challenge you will be creating an application that will create colored `<div>` tag each time the corresponding color is clicked. As each color (button) is clicked, it should increment the corresponding label. HTML and CSS are provided, the focus here is jQuery.**IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS**

- _HTML and CSS are provided_ and shouldn't require code changes.
- You can use jQuery's `.data()` method to retrieve the `data-color` HTML attributes. [A relevant StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5309926/how-to-get-the-data-id-attribute).

Base Mode:
---

Include JQuery in the project. Create and source in your JS file. Within, you'll need to create a click event for the "color-button" class which appends a div of class "color-cube" to the "container" div. 

You'll also need to use the "data-color" from the clicked button. Use this info to control what color the appended cube is. Ex: if the user clicked the "Red" button, a red cube should be added to the DOM.

Finally, the spans should have a count of how many of each color cube is on the page. Ex: The user clicks the "Yellow" button - a new yellow cube is appended to the DOM and the span with id of "yellow" should increment by 1.

Hard Mode:

Add a feature so when a color block is clicked, it is removed from the DOM.

Also, the counts of the color blocks should update. 

Ex: There are 6 Blue cubes on the DOM. The user clicks one of the blue cubes. It disappears and the blue cube counter updates to 5.
